# Project-Manager with Code Editor
Project Management tool to keep track of projects, project tasks, and their bugs/issues. Includes a built-in 'code editor' tool to create/edit/update/save code locally in the tool itself -- to go along with the 'management' aspect of the project.

** Currently, creating tasks and issues within projects is not implemented yet, but are on their way.
